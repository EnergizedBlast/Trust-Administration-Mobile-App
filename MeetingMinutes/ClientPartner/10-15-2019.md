## Topics Discussed
In this meeting, we got to see how Cheetah - the software the app will be based off of - functions, as well as the most noteworthy functionalities of the software. In particular, the following was discussed:
- The aesthetics of the app should be based off of Accunet, while the flow and form should be based off of Cheetah
- Navigation is important, and is broken up into four main tabs: Dashboards, Client Admin, Data Entry, and Account Overview
- Client Admin handles accounts; name and addresses; transaction history which contains all transactions processed on Cheeta; tasks and activities; tax forms; reviews
- Hover over actions should reveal more information on a particular piece of data or entry
- Lists should be able to be sorted by their various columns
- In the account overview, charts should be condense and user friendly
- At a glance, important information such as current cash balances and market value should be shown
- Relationships: Important parties that include the account holder, beneficiaries, and any other interested parties
- Clicking on a person in relationships should reveal important information such as name and address; clicking address pulls up a Maps location of said address
- Tasks & Activities: Should receive alerts
- Tasks are taken care of by clicking on it, and either resolving it, or dismissing it (in the latter case, the user gives a reason for dismissal)
- Creating a new task should alert admins and officers attached to a given task; new tasks should be able to be made on mobile
- Files: NO executable files allowed
- Potential feature: Allow uploading files via mobile app
- Approvals: When transaction is made, admin gets notified
- Approvals should be in another tab
- Could get a push notification of "items require your approval"
- Super Search: Search keyword(s) through all data accessible, returns all relevant matches and results
- Account importance should be determined by a mix of market value and the accounts you are listed for
- Allow the admin to create different views/priorities to narrow down their accounts listed at a time
## Things Clarified
Iris will update us with their test data we can use, as well as what tech stacks we may be limited to (TBD). We can begin development once we have the test data. Also asked about potential NDAs; will get more affirmative answer in the future as to when we have to worry about them.
