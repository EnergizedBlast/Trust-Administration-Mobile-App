## Topics Discussed
The client is looking for, in summation, a cross-platform mobile application that essentially does what their software (Cheetah) already does, with the additional mobile-based features. In more detail, we discussed the following:
- The company is based in the weath management industry
- The app is intended for business management officers
- There is no mobile application they've developed for this purpose
- Their current application is a browser based software called Cheetah
- Clients use typically Windows based OS; works best with Chrome and Edge
- No preference on programming language (needs confirmation, TBD)
- Must be cross-compatible (iOS, Android)
- Desires mobile-specific features, such as mobile alerts and notifications
- User is able to see relationships on the account, who is linked to it, personal information (name, address, etc.); administration has a high level view of the account
- User is able to access previously uploaded files attached to the account
- Should have the look and feel of Cheetah and Accutech
- Most important features according to client (in order/highest priority): Approval; Tasks and activities; Portfolio view; Relationships; Docs
## Things Clarified
On the next following Tuesday (10/15/2019), we are scheduled for a Webex meeting. Here, we'll get a tech demonstration of Cheetah; this should give us a much better idea as to what specifically we need to develop.
