## Topics Discussed
In this meeting, we showcased our app in its current state. Overall, Iris was pleased with the progress, and we talked about potential design choices we could make in the future. In particular, we are now considering having a side menu that can be swiped from the side that would take you to other pages; in return, a high level portfolio view would replace the current content on the main page (recent tasks and activities).
## Things Clarified
We realized that not every trust administrator is going to be managing the same accounts. We have access to all accounts with our credentials in the testing environment; to that end, we would like to ask Iris to create a mock account that would be restricted in access like an actual trust administrator.
